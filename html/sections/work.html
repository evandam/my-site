	I'm now a member of the <strong>Operations &amp; Technology Leadership Development Program</strong> at 
	<a href="http://www.thehartford.com/"><strong>The Hartford</strong></a>.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		I am a <strong>Server &amp; Storage Engineer</strong>, with work revolving around identifying and improving data for servers, as well as tracking them from build to decommission.
		This provides great insight into corporate infrastructure, and how capacity is managed from both an IT and business perspective. Through assignments in this area, I have gained
		strong skills in <strong>Excel</strong> and <strong>MSBI</strong> tools, along with a better understanding of how technology supports a company as large as The Hartford. 
	</li>
	<li>
		I also worked on a side project to create an app to be used by the O&amp;T LDP's recruiting team. The app has gone through an iterative process - beginning as a web app using <strong>Python</strong>
		and <strong>Django</strong>. It is now being developed as a mobile application using <strong>PhoneGap</strong>, <strong>Bootstrap</strong>, <strong>jQuery</strong>, and <strong>Knockout.js</strong>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Overall, my role has been able to provide great exposure across the company, and allowed me to focus my work on my areas of interest and sharpen both my technical and communication skills.
	</li>

	In the summer before my senior year of college, I was a software developer
	at <strong>The Hartford</strong> in the <strong>Technology Leadership Development Program</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		My main task for this time was to create a <strong>Python</strong> from the ground up. Given a set of requirements, it was my responsibility to bring the application through all phases
		of the <strong>SDLC</strong> - creating use cases, development, unit testing, and providing proper documentation to bring it to maintenance.
	</li>
	<li>
		The application served as a central interface to file archives, offering both a user-friendly <strong>GUI</strong> and a <strong>RESTful</strong> interface created by the <strong>Flask</strong>
		web framework.
	</li>
</ul>

	At <strong>Marist</strong>, I was a <strong>Student Programmer</strong> in <strong>Admin Computing</strong>.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Some of my work included <strong>front-end development</strong>, creating a <strong>mobile-responsive</strong> theme for one of Marist's sites.
	</li>
	<li>
		I also developed and maintained various portlets used by students and faculty using the <strong>Liferay</strong> web framework.
