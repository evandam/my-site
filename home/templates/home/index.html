    <p class="subtitle">
      I'm a data engineer with a passion for application development.
      I like writing clean and efficient code to solve complex problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I studied Computer Science at Marist College with a minor in Information Technology,
      and a concentration in Game Design and Programming.
      I held a job on campus as a student developer, working on projects like
      applying responsive web design to our student web portal.

      I then went through the Ops, Tech, and Data Leadership Development Program at The Hartford.
      Through this program, I gained experience as an app developer, technical analyst, web developer,
      and data engineer.
      At the end of the program, I joined the Big Data & Analytics team full-time as a data engineer.
      I currently work heavily in Linux shell scripting, Python development, and big data tools like
      Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Tableau for data visualization.
